School districts  need an accurate estimate of the number of students that may attend their schools. Below is a map of primary schools in London. In general, students attend the school closest to where they live. Click anywhere on the map to see the distance between that point and all the schools on the map.

    figure: x-geopad(width=600 height=400)
      canvas.voronoi(width=600 height=400)
      svg
        circle.move(cx=40 cy=60 name="a")
        circle.move(cx=60 cy=80 name="b")
        circle.move(cx=80 cy=100 name="c")
